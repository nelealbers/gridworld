# GridWorldSingle

Implementation of Gridworld domains. 

GridWorldSingle: Some experimental domains.

GridWorldOrient: The [Gridworld](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3020419.3020441) domains used in the work of Norm Ferns in which the agent's state is a combination of its orientation and its location in the grid. The parameter "augmented" can be set to True to create a domain in which the abstract states of the coarsest Markov state abstraction are different from the ones of a Q*-irrelevance abstraction.

The implementation is based on OpenAI Gym 0.15.4.
